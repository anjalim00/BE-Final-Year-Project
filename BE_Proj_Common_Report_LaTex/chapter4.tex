\chapter{Planning for Next Semester}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a model for abstractive summarization using RNN and LSTM networks which will be the basis of text summarization. 
\item The extractive summarization achieved currently will be used for notes generation.
\item Once we complete the model, we will integrate it with a web page that would act as the UI for this project.
\item Additionally, we will establish database connection to store the activity of users.
\end{itemize}
